    "# This program computes the \"distance\" between two text files\n",

    "#    (2) it is converted into a list of alphanumeric \"words\"\n",
    "#        Here a \"word\" is a sequence of consecutive alphanumeric\n",

    "#        Case is not significant.\n",
    "#    (3) for each word, its frequency of occurrence is determined\n",
    "#    (4) the word/frequency lists are sorted into order alphabetically\n",
